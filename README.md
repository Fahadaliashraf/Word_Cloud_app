About the Word Cloud Generator
The Word Cloud Generator is a Streamlit-powered application designed to visualize the frequency of words in text documents. It provides a quick and intuitive way to see which words are most prevalent in a given document, excluding common stopwords which often do not contribute much meaning to the text analysis. The app accepts text files, PDFs, and DOCX formats, making it versatile for various users, including educators, data analysts, and researchers interested in textual analysis.

Features
Multi-format Support: Accepts .txt, .pdf, and .docx files.
Customizable Stopwords: Users can add specific stopwords they wish to exclude from the analysis.
Interactive Visualization: Generates dynamic word clouds that visually represent data from the text.
Downloadable Outputs: Users can download the frequency data of words as a CSV file.
